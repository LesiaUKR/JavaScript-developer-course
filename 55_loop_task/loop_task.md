Let's improve the Tips Calculator from the previous task using loops.
Your tasks:
1. Create the bills array containing all 10 test bill values.
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)
3. Use the calculateTips() function we wrote before to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform 10 calculations.
Test data: 31, 95, 276, 540, 27, 205, 11, 1180, 96, 57.
Call calculateTips() in the loop and use the push() method to add values to the tips and totals arrays.
4. Write a calculateAverage() function that takes an array called arr as a parameter. This function calculates the average of all numbers in a given array. This is a difficult task! Here's how to solve it:
4.1. First, you will need to add all the values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable “sum” that starts at 0. Then loop through the array using a for loop. At each iteration, add the current value to the sum variable.
