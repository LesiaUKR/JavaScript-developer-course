Let's go back to the BMI index! This time, we'll use objects to do the calculations! 
BMI = weight / height ** 2 = weight / (height * height) (weight in kg and height in meters)
Your task:
We have two friends - Jack and Mike
1. For each of them, create an object with properties of its first name, last name, weight and height (Jack White and Mike Black).
2. Create a BMI calculation method for each object to calculate BMI (same method for both objects). Store the BMI value in a property and also return it from the method.
3. Log into the console who has the higher BMI, also the full name and the corresponding BMI. Example: "Jack White BMI (25.7) is higher than Mike Black (22.4)!"
Test Data: Jack weight 79 kg, height 1.70 m. Mike weighs 91 kg and his height is 1.93 m.
Happy coding!
